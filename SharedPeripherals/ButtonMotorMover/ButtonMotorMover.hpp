 *
 * \brief Class that causes a motor to rotate forward when one button is pressed and backword when anouther button is.
 *
 * This class is ment to control motors by buttons. 
 * This is a very common thing on MRDC robots application.
 * Examples are:
 *   Motor rotating a shaft to suck up balls.
 *   Motor lifting  a lever to open up a box.
 *   Motor rotating to pull a rope.
 *   Motor rotating to move a vacuum hose.
 *   Motor rotating to move a aluminam arm to hold in a bowling ball.
 *   Liniar Actuator extenting to press a button.
