 *
 * This class is meant as an example.  It is not useful by itself
 * rather its usefulness is only a function of how much it helps
 * the reader. 
 *
 * To create a new peripheral copy this file and the associated .cpp file to a new directory, 
 * Replace every instance of Vacuum in both files with the name of your peripheral.
